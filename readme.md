# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

A deep learning-based stock price prediction system using LSTM neural networks and technical indicators.

## üìà Overview

This project implements a sophisticated stock price prediction model that uses:

- **LSTM Neural Networks** for time series forecasting
- **Technical Indicators** (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, etc.)
- **Historical OHLCV data** from Yahoo Finance
- **Early Stopping** and **Gradient Clipping** for stable training

The model achieves excellent performance with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) typically around 1.5-2%.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-feature Analysis**: Uses 12 different technical indicators
- **Robust Preprocessing**: Handles missing data and outliers gracefully
- **Model Validation**: Comprehensive train/validation/test split
- **Real-time Prediction**: Predicts next day's closing price
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE evaluation
- **Visualization**: Comparative plots of actual vs predicted prices

## üìä Technical Indicators Used

- Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- Daily Returns
- High-Low Spread
- Moving Averages (5, 10, 20 days)
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch yfinance pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
````

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arunarun58/stock-prediction-lstm.git
cd stock-prediction-lstm
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts:

```
Enter stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT): MSFT
Enter number of years of data (max 10): 5
```

### Example Output

```
Fetching data for MSFT from 2019-03-27 to 2024-03-27...
Training samples: 1717
Validation samples: 245
Test samples: 491

Epoch 135/200, Train Loss: 0.000188, Val Loss: 0.000142
Early stopping triggered!

Current closing price: 511.46 USD
Predicted closing price for tomorrow (MSFT): 504.63 USD
Predicted change: -6.83 USD (-1.33%)

Model Performance on Test Set:
RMSE: 8.01
MAE: 6.33
MAPE: 1.50%
```

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

```python
StockLSTM(
  (lstm): LSTM(12, 128, num_layers=2, batch_first=True, dropout=0.3)
  (fc): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=1)
  (dropout): Dropout(p=0.3, inplace=False)
)
```

### Training Parameters

- **Sequence Length**: 60 days
- **Hidden Size**: 128 units
- **LSTM Layers**: 2
- **Dropout**: 0.3
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Early Stopping Patience**: 15 epochs

## üìà Performance Metrics

The model typically achieves:

- **MAPE**: 1.5-2.0% (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **RMSE**: 1.5-2.0% of stock price
- **Training Time**: 2-5 minutes (depending on data size)

## üéØ Supported Stocks

Any stock available on Yahoo Finance:

- **US Stocks**: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, etc.
- **International Stocks**: Using appropriate tickers
- **ETFs and Indices**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Disclaimers

### Technical Limitations

- Maximum 10 years of historical data
- Daily frequency only (no intraday prediction)
- Market closures and holidays are not specifically handled

### Financial Disclaimers

> **Important**: This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Never invest based solely on algorithmic predictions. Always consult with qualified financial advisors before making investment decisions.

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Features

```python
# Add to feature_cols list
feature_cols = ["Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume", "Return",
                "HL_Spread", "MA5", "MA10", "MA20", "RSI", "MACD",
                "Your_New_Feature"]
```

### Modifying Model Parameters

```python
model = StockLSTM(
    input_size=len(feature_cols),
    hidden_size=256,  # Increase hidden units
    num_layers=3,     # Add more layers
    dropout=0.2       # Adjust dropout
)
```
